## 📊 Trajectory Data Format

All trajectory recordings follow a canonical schema for maximum interoperability with R3F, Remotion, Three.js, and other animation systems.

### Schema Definition

```typescript
interface Trajectory {
  dt: number;              // Time step between frames (seconds)
  frames: Frame[];         // Ordered list of frames
  meta: {
    body_id: string;       // Fully qualified: "rapier://sim-123/body-1"
    total_time: number;    // Total duration (seconds)
    num_frames: number;    // Frame count
  };
}

interface Frame {
  t: number;                               // Absolute time (seconds)
  position: [number, number, number];      // [x, y, z] in meters
  rotation: [number, number, number, number];  // Quaternion [x, y, z, w]
  velocity?: [number, number, number];     // Optional: linear velocity (m/s)
  angular_velocity?: [number, number, number];  // Optional: angular velocity (rad/s)
}
```

### JSON Example

```json
{
  "dt": 0.016,
  "frames": [
    {
      "t": 0.0,
      "position": [0, 1, 0],
      "rotation": [0, 0, 0, 1],
      "velocity": [0, 0, 0]
    },
    {
      "t": 0.016,
      "position": [0.1, 1.01, 0],
      "rotation": [0, 0.01, 0, 0.9999],
      "velocity": [6.25, 0.61, 0]
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "body_id": "rapier://sim-abc123/ball",
    "total_time": 4.8,
    "num_frames": 300
  }
}
```

### Usage in React Three Fiber

```tsx
import { useRef } from "react";
import { useFrame } from "@react-three/fiber";

function AnimatedObject({ trajectory }) {
  const ref = useRef();

  useFrame((state) => {
    const elapsed = state.clock.getElapsedTime();
    const frameIdx = Math.floor(elapsed / trajectory.dt);
    const frame = trajectory.frames[frameIdx % trajectory.frames.length];

    if (frame && ref.current) {
      ref.current.position.fromArray(frame.position);
      ref.current.quaternion.fromArray(frame.rotation);
    }
  });

  return (
    <mesh ref={ref}>
      <sphereGeometry args={[0.5]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial color="orange" />
    </mesh>
  );
}
```

### Usage in Remotion

```tsx
import { useCurrentFrame } from "remotion";
import { ThreeCanvas } from "@remotion/three";

export const PhysicsAnimation = ({ trajectory }) => {
  const frame = useCurrentFrame();
  const frameData = trajectory.frames[frame];

  return (
    <AbsoluteFill>
      <ThreeCanvas>
        <mesh position={frameData.position}>
          <sphereGeometry />
        </mesh>
      </ThreeCanvas>
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

### Design Notes

- **Quaternions for rotation:** More compact and interpolation-friendly than Euler angles
- **Absolute time:** Each frame has absolute time `t`, making scrubbing easier
- **Constant dt:** Frames are evenly spaced, simplifying playback
- **Optional velocities:** Include if needed for motion blur or physics visualization
- **Qualified body_id:** Format is `rapier://sim-{id}/{body_id}` for traceability

- 📦 No external dependencies
- 🎯 Exact mathematical solutions
- ✅ Always available (no service required)

**Limitations:**
- Only spherical objects (for collisions)
- No complex shapes
- No multi-body interactions
- No friction or material properties

#### 2️⃣ Simulation Primitives (Requires Rapier Service)

**Best for:** Complex physics, multi-body dynamics, visualization data

Low-level building blocks for rigid-body simulations:

| Tool | What It Does | When to Use |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| `create_simulation` | Initialize physics world | Start any simulation |
| `add_rigid_body` | Add objects (box, sphere, capsule, etc.) | Build scene |
| `step_simulation` | Advance time | Run physics |

| `destroy_simulation` | Cleanup resources | End simulation |

**Characteristics:**
- 🦀 Requires Rapier service
- 🔄 Stateful (track simulation ID)
- 🧩 Composable (combine for complex scenarios)
- 💪 Full rigid-body dynamics

**Typical workflow:**
```python
# 1. Create world
sim = create_simulation(gravity_y=-9.81)

# 2. Add objects
add_rigid_body(sim.sim_id, "ground", type="static", shape="plane")
add_rigid_body(sim.sim_id, "ball", type="dynamic", shape="sphere",
               radius=0.5, position=[0, 5, 0])

# 3. Run simulation
step_simulation(sim.sim_id, steps=300)

# 4. Record for visualization
trajectory = record_trajectory(sim.sim_id, "ball", steps=300)

## 🎓 Example Conversations

### Projectile Motion
```
User: A golf ball is hit at 70 m/s at 15 degrees. How far does it go and what's the flight time?

LLM: [calls calculate_projectile_motion(70, 15)]

     Range ≈ 249.7 m
     Time of flight ≈ 3.694 s
     Maximum height ≈ 16.73 m

     Here are 50 trajectory points for visualization...
```

```
User: What angle gives maximum range for a cannonball fired at 100 m/s?

LLM: [calls calculate_projectile_motion multiple times with different angles]

     The optimal angle is 45°, which gives:
     - Maximum range: 1019.4 m
     - Flight time: 14.4 s
     - Peak height: 254.8 m
```

### Collision Detection
```
User: Two asteroids: one at (0,0,0) moving at 1000 m/s in x direction,
      another at (50000, 100, 0) moving at -800 m/s in x. Will they collide?

LLM: [calls check_collision with both objects]

     Yes, they will collide!
     - Collision time: ~27.8 seconds
     - Impact location: (27,778, 100, 0)
     - Impact speed: 1,800 m/s
     - This would be a devastating impact given the closing speed.
```

```
User: Two cars 500m apart, one at 60 mph, other at 45 mph heading toward each other.
      When do they collide?

LLM: [calls check_collision]

     Collision in 10.7 seconds at position 250m from car 1's starting point.
     Combined approach speed is 105 mph (46.9 m/s).
```

### Force & Energy Calculations
```
User: What force is needed to accelerate a 1500 kg car at 3 m/s²?

LLM: [calls calculate_force(1500, 3)]

     Force required: 4,500 N (Newtons)
     This is about 1,011 pounds of force.
```

```
User: What's the kinetic energy of a 2000 kg car at 30 m/s (about 67 mph)?

LLM: [calls calculate_kinetic_energy(2000, 30)]

     Kinetic energy: 900,000 J (Joules)
     That's 900 kJ or 0.25 kWh of energy.
     For perspective, this is why car crashes at highway speeds are so dangerous.
```

### Momentum Analysis
```
User: Calculate momentum of a 70 kg runner at 10 m/s

LLM: [calls calculate_momentum(70, 10)]

     Momentum: 700 kg⋅m/s

```

### Complex Multi-Step Problems
```
User: I'm designing a water fountain. Water shoots up at 15 m/s.
      How high does it go and when does it come back down?

LLM: [calls calculate_projectile_motion(15, 90)]

     The water will:
     - Rise to maximum height: 11.47 m
     - Take 1.53 seconds to reach peak
     - Return to ground level after 3.06 seconds total
     - Have the same 15 m/s speed when it lands (just downward)
```

```
User: A basketball player shoots from 2m high at 7 m/s toward a hoop
      3.05m high and 4.6m away. What angles work?

LLM: [calls calculate_projectile_motion with various angles]

     Two possible angles work:
     1. Low arc: 38° (faster, flatter shot)
     2. High arc: 52° (slower, higher shot)

     Most players use 50-55° for better chance of going in.
```

### Rigid Body Simulations
```

## 📝 Example Scripts

The `examples/` directory contains working demonstration scripts:

### Ready to Run (No External Services Required)

These examples use the built-in **analytic provider** and work immediately:

- **`00_quick_start.py`** - Quick demo of all 5 analytic tools
- **`01_simple_projectile.py`** - Cannonball trajectories, basketball shots, angle comparisons
- **`02_collision_detection.py`** - Car crashes, near misses, asteroid collisions
- **`03_force_energy_momentum.py`** - F=ma, kinetic energy, momentum conservation
- **`04_r3f_visualization.py`** - Generate React Three Fiber visualization data

```bash
# Run any example
python examples/00_quick_start.py
python examples/01_simple_projectile.py
# ... etc
```

### Requires Rapier Service

This example demonstrates rigid-body simulations but needs the Rapier service running:

- **`05_rapier_simulation.py`** - Bouncing balls, collisions, stacking boxes

```bash
# Start Rapier service first (see RAPIER_SERVICE.md)
docker run -p 9000:9000 chuk-rapier-service

# Then run example
python examples/05_rapier_simulation.py
```

**Note:** Examples 00-04 provide full functionality for calculations, collisions, and trajectory generation. Example 05 showcases advanced rigid-body physics when you have the Rapier service available.

## 🛡️ Safety & Limits

### Recommended Ranges

Understanding these limits helps prevent timeouts, instabilities, and confusion:

| Parameter | Recommended | Maximum | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Units** | meters, kg, seconds | - | SI units throughout |
| **dt** | 0.008 - 0.033 | 0.001 - 0.1 | <0.008 = overkill, >0.033 = unstable |
| **steps** | 100 - 5000 | 10,000 | Depends on dt and complexity |
| **bodies** | 1 - 100 | 1,000 | Performance degrades >100 |
| **gravity** | -20 to 0 m/s² | -100 to +100 | Earth = -9.81 |
| **velocity** | 0 - 100 m/s | 1,000 m/s | Very high speeds may cause tunneling |
| **mass** | 0.1 - 10,000 kg | 1e-6 - 1e6 | Extreme ratios cause instability |

### Public Service Limits

The public Rapier service at `https://rapier.chukai.io` has these limits:

- **Max steps per call:** 5,000
- **Max bodies per simulation:** 100
- **Max concurrent simulations:** 10 per IP
- **Request timeout:** 30 seconds
- **Max simulation lifetime:** 1 hour (auto-cleanup)

For larger simulations, run your own Rapier service (see [RAPIER_SERVICE.md](RAPIER_SERVICE.md)).

### Common Pitfalls

#### ❌ Simulation explodes or bodies fly away

**Symptoms:**
- Bodies gain extreme velocities
- Objects disappear from view
- NaN values in positions

**Causes:**
- `dt` too large for the forces involved
- Very high mass ratios (1g object hitting 1000kg object)
- Extreme initial velocities

**Solutions:**
- Reduce `dt` to 0.008 or lower
- Use more similar masses (within 2-3 orders of magnitude)
- Limit initial velocities to <100 m/s

#### ❌ Simulation runs very slowly

**Symptoms:**
- Request takes >10 seconds
- Timeout errors
- High CPU usage

**Causes:**
- Too many bodies (>100)
- Very small `dt` (<0.005)
- Complex mesh colliders
- Too many steps (>5000)

**Solutions:**
- Reduce body count or simplify shapes
- Increase `dt` (balance accuracy vs. speed)
- Break large step counts into multiple calls
- Use primitive shapes (sphere, box) instead of meshes

#### ❌ Objects tunnel through each other

**Symptoms:**
- Fast-moving objects pass through walls
- Collisions not detected
- Objects appear inside each other

**Causes:**
- Very high velocities + large `dt`
- Thin colliders (<0.1m)
- Disabled continuous collision detection (CCD)

**Solutions:**
- Reduce `dt` for high-speed scenarios
- Thicken colliders (minimum 0.1m recommended)
- Reduce velocities
- Enable CCD if available (future feature)

### Best Practices

1. **Start simple:** Test with 2-3 bodies before scaling up
2. **Validate inputs:** Check for NaN, Inf, extreme values before simulation
3. **Monitor performance:** Track step time, adjust `dt`/steps accordingly
4. **Cleanup:** Always `destroy_simulation` when done (prevent memory leaks)
5. **Use analytic when possible:** For simple scenarios, analytic is faster and exact
